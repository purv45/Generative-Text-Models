Text Generation with GPT-2 and LSTM
A Python notebook showcasing text generation using two approaches: GPT-2 (with the transformers library) and a custom LSTM model (implemented in PyTorch).  The notebook demonstrates generating text from prompts.

GPT-2 and LSTM for Text Generation
This project provides examples of generating text. It uses GPT-2 (with Hugging Face's transformers) for high-level generation and a PyTorch-based LSTM for character-level textÂ generation.
